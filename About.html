      <p>Knowing how often to replace tires isn’t just about taking good care of your vehicle and preventing expensive mistakes. Tires are an extremely important part of your vehicle’s safety.
        Worn or old tires can lead to a variety of problems, including:
        Compromised road grip due to a worn-down tread
        Blowouts that leave you stranded or even cause you to crash
        Difficulty stopping and braking effectively
        Additionally, uneven wheel alignments and balance problems will not only cause irregular and premature tire wear, they can cause expensive problems for your vehicle, leaving you dealing with a hefty car repair bill in the future.

        Each year, roughly 11,000 tire-related wrecks occur on the road. Don’t blow off tire maintenance as something only “car people” do. Every driver on the road should are about the health and safety of their passengers and vehicles. </p>
